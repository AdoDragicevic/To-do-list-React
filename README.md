### TECH
* TypeScript 
* React (Custom hooks, Context, Reducer) 
* Sass (Scss, Block-element--modifier)

### FUNCTIONALITIES
* create lists & add items to lists
* edit lists / items
* delete lists / items
* mark items as complete
* show / hide completed items
* list displays the number of items it holds
* local storage

### WHAT I LEARNED
As I started learning React I made this app with class components. I also designed it to look beautiful and intuitive. After learning TypeScript I returned to completely refactor it with TS and my new gained React knowledge. Using Context is an overkill for such a small app, but I wanted to demonstrate my skillset.

Key points:

* Clean code
After deciding to to a complete refactor on this app, I was surprised to see how messy and unclean the code is. I am continually improving in programming, and clean code is something I care about exceptionaly. I am proud to see that in a short time I have improved so much and was able to completely refactor this app in a way that makes the code clean.

* React
As I started learning React I came upon a tutorial that builds a todo list. Before watching it I gave myself a challenge to build the app without the tutorial and also add a new feature, ability to add lists and items, instead of only items. I succeded. After learning Hooks and TypeScript I saw refactoring this project as a great exercise in implementing what I learned.

* Design, CSS and Sass
I designed the app from scratch, including choosing the color palettes and making sure the app feels responsive (e.g. providing an animation when deleting an item / list). To improve my CSS skillset I opted out of using a library like bootstrap, and wrote CSS with Sass from scratch. I used the BEM methodology and saw it drastically reduces CSS code repetition as oposed to scoping CSS to each component.
