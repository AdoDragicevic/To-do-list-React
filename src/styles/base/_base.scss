    However, by defining it in px we change the browser font size that the user can change in the browser settings.
    This would be bad because some people want to increase the default font size, so we use %
    Default font size is 16px
    100% would be 16px
    But we want 10px, so we calculate 10 / 16
    1rem = 62.5% (of what the user sets in browser as default; or 16px if the user doesn't change it) */
    font-size: 62.5%; /* 1 rem = 10px */
